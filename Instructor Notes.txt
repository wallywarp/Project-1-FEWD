Hi Lee,

Thanks for taking the time to view this read me and the project overall. I wanted to make a note here that I used the notes function extensively in the project to track anything I attempted that didnt work, an idea that I thought might be possible but I didn't know how to do, or general notes for the project.  

I hope that helps when going to view the project as an outsider, but if you have any questions/prefer I do that in another way in the future please feel free to reach out!
Best,
-Logan C
